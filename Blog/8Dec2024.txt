Hello, this is my first blog post concerning my Japanese learning progress so far (very little).
The first time I tried to learn Japanese was in spring of 2024, using Duolingo.
As some of you might know, Duolingo is not the best resource for using japanese, as it has some inaccuracies and isn't very efficent.
